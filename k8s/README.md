# Minikube Installation
For the purposes of our project, we will be using a tool called **Minikube** that will start up a little Kubernetes cluster on our local machines for learning purposes. Minikube is not recommended for production usage. Both AWS and GCP have their own variants of Kubernetes that would work better for production usage, at least in the cloud realm!

NOTES FOR LATER
- minikube installation
- ingress
- local docker registry
- PVC
- image pull policy
